# tufts-math-modeling
A collection of my some assignments and projects from Tufts' MATH87 class (Mathematical Modeling and Computation)

Course Description (from https://math.tufts.edu/current-students/courses):

A survey of major techniques in the use of mathematics to model physical, biological, economic, and other systems; topics may include derivative-based optimization and sensitivity analysis, linear programming, graph algorithms, probabilistic modeling, Monte-Carlo methods, difference equations, and statistical data fitting. This course includes an introduction to computing using a high-level programming language, and studies the transformation of mathematical objects into computational algorithms. 

Within this repo, I've included some of the more interesting assignments, including important rootfinding methods such as bisection, secant, and Newton's Method. There is also work on the Branch-and-Bound Algorithm, (dual) linear programming, probability and Markov processes, and a midterm report supply chain optimization.
